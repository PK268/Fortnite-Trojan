# Fortnite-Trojan
This is a very simple program that deletes all fortnite.exe files from your computer.

Use: VERY SIMPLE, click the "Generate!" button and it will delete all the fortnite.exe related files on the computer it is running on. The text box does not change output and can be blank if you want. This will only delete 4 files and not the entire game because thats a little too cruel. All this does is make the game not run. The game can be repaired very easily with no data / ingame progress lost. :)
